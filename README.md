###Milestone 3 Feedback
Really awesome mockups here. Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier IV.
 
##Suggestions
- Take a look at Bootstrap's [Scrollspy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy) plugin, and [static navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-static-top)
- Bypass the project detail pages for now for the sake of MVP. Awesome feature going forward, however.
- Become familiar with [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), and become an expert at the [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-basic). Both of these things will help you create your layout very efficiently.

###Milestone 4 Feedback
- Good start with the parallax... I think this can come together quite fast.
- take &lt;footer&gt; out of  &lt;div class="sfooter-content"&gt;
- clean up  &lt;img&gt; tags... they should look like this:  &lt;img src="/media/images/landing-page-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="your alt text here"&gt;
- your code for the background parallax image is correct for the  &lt;section id="home"&gt;. Fix the background URL in CSS line 40 to be: "/media/images/landing-page-2.jpg"
- you can probably remove the  &lt;img&gt; tag from  &lt;section id="home"&gt; once you've fixed the parallax background
- take a look at the code for this example: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/bootstrap/sample-parallax.php
